  <h1>About Me</h1>
    Hi!  I'm Daniel, a graduate student who is interested in many new technologies and applications.  Some of the things I get excited about are deep learning, personalized medicine, virtual &amp; augmented reality, and the internet of things.
    My research projects focus on intersections of these topics, and how I can best use my skills.

    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
      I have experience implementing a wide range of traditional statistical learning algorithms in my smaller-scale research projects.  The most common of these are Logistic Regression, Lasso, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests.
      For my more complex projects and those with less structured data, I have implemented a range of more complex algorithms.  These include recurrent and convolutional neural networks (RNN &amp; CNN), reinforcement learning, and autoencoder networks.
      
    <h3>Programming</h3>
      For basic statistics and supervised learning models, I use R for its simplicity and convenient modularity.
      For more complex scientific computing, simulation, and general-purpose work I prefer Python for its wonderful packages, particularly Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter.
      For deep learning projects, I use either TensorFlow or PyTorch.
      For robotics and other microcontroller / embedded system design projects, I use Embedded C.
      <em>I'm always happy to learn a new language for the task at hand.</em>
    
    <h3>Mathematics &amp; Simulation</h3>
      Many of the systems I model use Markov Chains, Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes, or more general frameworks.
      Solving a modeled system may require Linear or Convex Optimization, or a Dynamic Programming algorithm.
      For systems without a direct solution, or for comparison to real-world data, Monte Carlo methods provide a useful simulation framework.
      
    <h3>Electronics</h3>
      I'm proficient in using OrCAD, PSPICE, and a variety of PCB layout packages for circuit design, simulation, and layout, as well as circuit board fabrication.
