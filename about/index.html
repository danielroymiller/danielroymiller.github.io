	<h1>About Me</h1>
	  	<p>Hi! I'm Daniel, a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.  My primary research interest is applying machine learning to pediatric healthcare.  I work with other researchers and healthcare providers, using mathematical analyses and optimizations to improve the quality of patient care.</p>
      
      <p>My favorite hobby is rock climbing, both indoors and outdoors.  I collect maps from my favorite national and state parks and monuments, and hope to one day visit them all.  I also enjoy custom-building computers for a variety of uses, including scientific computing and gaming.</p>
