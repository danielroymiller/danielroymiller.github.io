    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm DanielI am currently the Lead Data Scientist at Carta Healthcare. We help providers to improve patient care by making all forms of data actionable. I'm specifically interested in using automation to reduce the workload on frontline providers, and extracting useful clinical information from messy and unstructured data sources.</p>

        <p>I hold a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford with a dissertation in machine learning and control methodologies with applications to medical computing. I worked extensively with the SURF research group and created WAVES: the largest open-access pediatric clinical waveform dataset. I've published work on deep learning, convolutional neural networks, clinical decision support, wireless body-area networks, and operations research.</p>
      
        <p>I enjoy rock climbing, both indoors and outdoors.  I collect maps from my favorite national and state parks and monuments, and hope to one day visit them all.  I also enjoy custom-building computers for a variety of uses, including scientific computing and gaming.</p>
